## Validated 0.1.39 topology recheck — 2026-10-05

The promoted software baseline remains **0.1.38**. The decision-bearing 0.1.39 candidate evidence is now intentionally compact:

| Region | Independent lanes | Three-GPU pipelined layer split |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| M=1 fixed decode | 73.63 ± 1.67 tok/s | **120.62 ± 1.24 tok/s**¹ |
| M=2 fixed decode | 143.19 ± 3.06 tok/s | **147.84 ± 2.26 tok/s** |
| M=3 fixed decode | 192.16 ± 4.11 tok/s | **209.66 ± 4.02 tok/s** |
| Three ~15K cold prompts | **5901.34 ± 55.16 tok/s** | 3289.19 ± 18.83 tok/s |
| Three ~110K cold prompts | 5822.71 ± 4.49 tok/s | **6028.09 ± 14.50 tok/s** |

¹ M=1 is the retained three-GPU layer-split single-request control on the same 0.1.39 binary; M=2 and M=3 use the exact fixed pipeline config: explicit split `18,34`, `--batch 3 --batch-groups 3 --trim-stage-weights`, shared expert arena.

The new M=2 point is **147.84 ± 2.26 tok/s**, **+3.25%** over the matched two-independent-lane result. M=3 remains **+9.11%** in favor of the pipelined split. Cold-prefill behavior still crosses by length: ~15K x3 strongly favors lanes, while ~110K x3 narrowly favors the layer split. All retained PP requests report `cache_n=0`; the unique nonce is workload/length matched but not byte-identical across topology arms.

Broader 0.1.39 oversubscription, heterogeneity, workload-sensitivity, memory, FIFO and batch-only controls remain in raw evidence for auditability but are not part of the compact topology scorecard.

This repository keeps the current software baseline while preserving measured evidence under the engine generation that produced it.

## Current software baseline — Strata 0.1.38

```

The bounded 0.1.38 upstream-sync compatibility gate passed:

- full Python serving suite: **256 tests run / 7 skipped / no failures**
- CUDA **13.4.92**, sm_120 Release configure/build: **PASS**
- focused shared-arena/profile/source CTests: **3/3 PASS**
- live model-backed 3-lane shared-arena startup and simultaneous request routing: **PASS**

A matched single-lane compatibility A/B against the installed 0.1.31 production binary found a clear long-prompt prefill movement:

| Fresh prompt | 0.1.31 | 0.1.38 | Delta |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ~15K | 2498.4 tok/s | **2735.0 tok/s** | **+9.5%** |
| ~30K | 2594.7 tok/s | **2784.0 tok/s** | **+7.3%** |

This is a bounded one-sample-per-size directional A/B, not a replacement for the full model-backed benchmark campaign. Decode samples were too short and acceptance-sensitive for a version-level decode claim.

The current full architecture campaign has now been rerun on 0.1.38. The 0.1.31 Phase 3 lifecycle campaign and the 0.1.30 architecture matrix remain retained historical evidence; their measurements are not relabeled as 0.1.38.

Current sync record: [`docs/strata-0.1.38-promotion-20261003.md`](docs/strata-0.1.38-promotion-20261003.md). Current full campaign: [`docs/strata-0.1.38-full-campaign-20261003.md`](docs/strata-0.1.38-full-campaign-20261003.md). Current lane-local parking production/Hermes record: [`docs/lane-local-conversation-parking-20261003.md`](docs/lane-local-conversation-parking-20261003.md).

### Lane-local conversation parking — production path + Hermes eval

Current reference-host production uses three RTX 5070 Ti lanes only and enables upstream-native conversation parking at **4096 MiB / 4 slots / 8192 MiB MemAvailable floor per lane**. The RTX 5060 Ti is excluded from the serving pool.

In an exact matched reference-host deployment A/B around the standard Lanes supervisor, both arms used the same patched engine. Six stable mixed sessions measured:

| Turn | Wall OFF | Wall ON | Wall delta | Mean E2E delta | Aggregate completion TPS delta |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 cold/wake | 36.185 s | 36.223 s | +0.1% | +0.1% | -0.1% |
| 2 returning | 9.686 s | **6.232 s** | **-35.7%** | **-28.5%** | **+55.4%** |
| 3 returning | 9.688 s | **6.571 s** | **-32.2%** | **-25.7%** | **+59.1%** |

A later Hermes `eval` validation used real Hermes session persistence with the Strata provider override. Returning requests carried roughly **25K-token prompts**; normal hits reused about **25.1K–25.6K tokens** while reading only ~232–264 fresh tokens. Under the 4 GiB/lane byte budget, lane1 produced one real eviction; the affected revisit still completed with partial reuse (`16384` reused, ~9.5K freshly read) and preserved conversation continuity. Final observed parked state was ~1.73 GiB / 2.86 GiB / 1.10 GiB on lanes 0/1/2 with eviction counts 0/1/0.

## Current full benchmark generation — Strata 0.1.38

The current full campaign uses a fixed prompt contract within 0.1.38. Historical 0.1.30 prompt bytes were not retained, so cross-version workload deltas are descriptive unless separately byte-matched.

### Independent-lane scaling

| Active lanes | Common-wall aggregate TG | Speedup | Efficiency |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | **67.45 ± 2.20 tok/s** | 1.000× | 100.0% |
| 2 | **129.41 ± 2.95 tok/s** | **1.919×** | **95.9%** |
| 3 | **173.26 ± 6.67 tok/s** | **2.569×** | **85.6%** |

Corrected mixed fiction/coding/reasoning serving measured **178.86 ± 3.33 tok/s** over nine retained warm rotations.

### Shared arena memory

The historical 32K / resident-KV 8192 contract was rerun exactly for memory accounting:

| Arena mode | Two-engine PSS |
| --- | ---: |
| Private | **95.670 GiB** |
| Shared | **52.111 GiB** |
| Saved | **43.559 GiB / 45.53%** |

At the production 262K / resident-KV 32768 contract, PSS changed from **95.927 → 58.036 GiB**, saving **37.892 GiB / 39.50%**. The shared expert mapping remains 49,116,204 KiB `Shared_Dirty` with `Private_Dirty=0`.

### Heterogeneous isolation

After discarding an initial CPU-affinity-contaminated attempt, the retained disjoint-CPU ABBA run measured **68.90 tok/s** on the RTX 5070 Ti solo and **68.75 tok/s** while the RTX 5060 Ti ran concurrently. Raw fast-lane delta is **-0.22%**. An acceptance-adjusted model estimates **-0.74%**, with the arm coefficient interval crossing zero, so this run does not establish material fast-lane pacing.

### Independent lanes vs layer split

Within the 0.1.38 fixed campaign prompt, one warm request measured **67.45 tok/s** on one independent lane versus **101.90 ± 1.39 tok/s** on three-GPU layer split. Three simultaneous requests measured **173.26 tok/s** on three independent lanes versus **102.84 ± 0.70 tok/s** on the ordinary layer-split server's serial FIFO path.

Three-GPU layer-split cold PP measured **1033.1 ± 14.8 tok/s**. The old 0.1.30 contract measured 807.1 ± 11.8 tok/s, but those prompt bytes differ; the separately byte-matched 0.1.31→0.1.38 A/B remains the stronger version-level prefill evidence.

### Oversubscription

| Requests | Aggregate TG | Queue p50 | Queue p95 | E2E p95 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3 | **173.55 ± 3.34** | 2.9 ms | 8.8 ms | 9.08 s |
| 4 | **130.88 ± 1.12** | 4.9 ms | 8.20 s | 15.71 s |
| 6 | **183.98 ± 2.97** | 4.01 s | 8.64 s | 16.65 s |
| 9 | **183.38 ± 3.90** | 8.23 s | 16.83 s | 25.26 s |

### Retained previous software gate — Strata 0.1.34

The previous 0.1.34 compatibility record remains at [`docs/strata-0.1.34-promotion-20261002.md`](docs/strata-0.1.34-promotion-20261002.md).
## Retained full live baseline — Strata 0.1.31

```

The 0.1.31 sync passed the current compatibility/parity gate:

- Python serving suite: **156 passed / 7 skipped**
- CUDA 13.4 sm_120 Release build: **PASS**
- CTests: **47 passed / 2 skipped / 3 external-fixture unavailable**
- live text, vision, malformed-input, session-affinity, disconnect and recovery smoke: **PASS**
- upstream-native shared expert arena: **PASS**
- promoted scheduler on one persistent supervisor: **2/2/2 placement in all three waves**, affinity preserved

Persistent-wave continuation throughput:

| Wave | Placement | Common-wall TG |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 2 / 2 / 2 | **88.49 tok/s** |
| 2 | 2 / 2 / 2 | **87.17 tok/s** |
| 3 | 2 / 2 / 2 | **65.92 tok/s** |

The shared arena remained one physical mapping across all three lane engines: 49,116,200 KiB payload per mapping, `Shared_Dirty=49,116,200 KiB`, `Private_Dirty=0`.

Phase 3 then removed duplicate shared-arena source loading on the same 0.1.31 engine generation. Matched direct 3-lane ready time changed from **42.218 s → 27.133 s** (**-35.73%**), while the full reference-host deployment wake changed from the previously recorded **42.042 s → 34.031 s** (**-19.05%**). Lane 0 remains the population leader; lane 1/2 attach only after pack/size/readiness validation and skip their duplicate source loads. Production correctness smoke remained PASS.

## Retained benchmark generation — Strata 0.1.30

The complete architecture-performance matrix was measured on Strata 0.1.30 and remains versioned as such. It is not relabeled as 0.1.31.

### 1 → 2 → 3 independent-lane scaling

| Active lanes | Common-wall aggregate TG | Speedup | Parallel efficiency |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | **70.804 ± 1.546 tok/s** | 1.000× | 100.0% |
| 2 | **132.760 ± 3.129 tok/s** | **1.875×** | **93.8%** |
| 3 | **189.486 ± 3.205 tok/s** | **2.676×** | **89.2%** |

### Shared expert arena memory

| Arena mode | Two-engine PSS |
| --- | ---: |
| Private | **98.924864 GiB** |
| Shared | **52.083863 GiB** |
| Saved | **46.841001 GiB / 47.35%** |

### Heterogeneous isolation

RTX 5070 Ti x8 vs RTX 5070 Ti x8 + RTX 5060 Ti x4:

| Measurement | Mean TG |
| --- | ---: |
| RTX 5070 Ti solo | **71.563 ± 1.760 tok/s** |
| RTX 5070 Ti concurrent | **71.163 ± 1.456 tok/s** |
| RTX 5060 Ti concurrent | **57.575 ± 1.527 tok/s** |
| Common-wall concurrent aggregate | **113.898 ± 2.985 tok/s** |

The fast-lane difference is smaller than ordinary run-to-run dispersion in this measured pair.

### Mixed three-lane serving

Rotating fiction/coding/reasoning across the three RTX 5070 Ti lanes produced **184.669 ± 5.966 tok/s** common-wall aggregate across nine retained runs.

### Independent lanes vs layer split

Matched 0.1.30 comparison:

- one warm request: one independent lane **70.804 ± 1.546 tok/s** vs three-GPU layer split **102.976 ± 1.527 tok/s**
- three simultaneous requests: three independent lanes **189.486 ± 3.205 tok/s** vs the ordinary layer-split server's serial FIFO path **102.588 ± 1.629 tok/s**

These are workload-region measurements, not a universal winner claim.

Full 0.1.30 record: [`docs/strata-0.1.30-promotion-20261001.md`](docs/strata-0.1.30-promotion-20261001.md).

## Serving-control state

Phase 1, Phase 2, and the current Phase 3 shared-arena lifecycle gate are complete on the independent-lane architecture.

- production new-session placement: `balanced-additive-new-prefill-retained-state-proxy-v1`
- rollback policy: `safe-affinity-live-state-v1`
- extra CPU/PCIe shared-pressure placement coefficients: not promoted
- bounded admission for the all-complete-immediately workload: not promoted
- workload-regime adaptation: not promoted

There is no mandatory next serving phase. Architecture challengers remain evidence-triggered and stay deferred until a measured bottleneck activates them.
